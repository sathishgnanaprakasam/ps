Problem: Given a number N, check whether it is a even number or odd number.

Test Cases:

Input: 2
Output: Even

Input: 3
Output: Odd

Algorithm 1:

Checking the divisibility of 2

- Get the input number N
- Check whether the number is divisible by 2 by using the modulo operator
- If the number is divisible by 2, then print "Even" else print "Odd"

Algorithm 2:

Checking for the last digit of the number

- Get the input number N
- Get the last digit of the number
- Check if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 then print "Even" else print "Odd"

Algorithm 3:

Checking for the last bit of the number

- Get the input number N
- Check the last bit of the number
- If the last bit is 0, then print "Even" else print "Odd"

Algorithm 4:

Subtract the number by 2 until the number becomes 0 or 1

- Get the input number N
- Subtract the number by 2 until the number becomes 0 or 1
- If the number becomes 0, then print "Even" else print "Odd"

Algorithm 5:

Add the number by 2 until the number becomes N or exceeds N

- Get the input number N
- Add the number by 2 until the number becomes N or exceeds N
- If the number becomes N, then print "Even" else print "Odd"
