# Arrays - Exercises

## Exercise 1

Two Sum Problem: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Input 1:

    nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    target = 9

Output 1:

    [0, 1]

Input 2:

    nums = [3, 2, 4]
    target = 6

Output 2:

    [1, 2]

Input 3:

    nums = [3, 3]
    target = 6

Output 3:

    [0, 1]

## Exercise 2

Find the frequency of each element in the array.

Input 1:

    arr = [1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1]

Output 1:

    {1: 2, 2: 4, 8: 1, 3: 1, 5: 1}

## Exercise 3

Given an array of integers, remove the duplicates from the array.

Input 1:

    arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1]

Output 1:

    [1, 2, 3]

## Exercise 4

Given two arrays, find the elements that are common in both the arrays.

Input 1:

    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
    arr2 = [2, 3, 4, 5]

Output 1:

    [2, 3]

## Exercise 5

Given an array of integers, find the element that occurs the most number of times.

Input 1:

    arr = [1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1]

Output 1:

    2

## Homework 1

Given an array of integers, find the first element that does not repeat.

Input 1:

    arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1]

Output 1:

    3

## Homework 2

Given an array, check if two arrays are identical.

Input 1:

    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
    arr2 = [2, 3, 4, 5]

Output 1:

    False

Input 2:

    arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
    arr2 = [1, 2, 3]

Output 2:

    True

## Homework 3

Given an array of integers, check whether the array is sorted in an ascending order or not.

Input 1:

    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output 1:

    True

Input 2:

    arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]

Output 2:

    False

## Homework 4

Given an array of integers with 0's in it, move all the 0's to the end of the array without changing the order of non-zero elements.

Input 1:

    arr = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]

Output 1:

    [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

Input 2:

    arr = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3]

Output 2:

    [1, 2, 3, 0, 0]

## Homework 5

Given an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element in the array. If there is no greater element, return -1.

Input 1:

    arr = [4, 5, 2, 10]

Output 1:

    {4: 5, 5: 10, 2: 10, 10: -1}

Input 2:

    arr = [3, 2, 1]

Output 2:

    {3: -1, 2: -1, 1: -1}
